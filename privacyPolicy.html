				<p><strong>DATA PRIVACY STATEMENT OF AUTO WELDERT GMBH</strong></p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 1 General Information</strong></p>
				<p>The following information provides a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you
					visit our website. Personal data is any data with which you can be personally identified. The
					operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
					personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and
					this privacy policy. Please note that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating
					by e-mail) may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third
					parties is not possible. You will find detailed information on data protection in our privacy policy
					listed below this text.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 2 Data Collection on this Website</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</strong></p>
				<p>Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find their contact
					details in the legal notice of this website.</p>
				<p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p>
				<p>Your data is collected on the one hand by you communicating it to us. This may include, for example,
					data that you enter in a contact form. Other data is automatically collected by our IT systems when
					you visit the website. This is mainly technical data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or
					time of page access). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.</p>
				<p><strong>What do we use your data for?</strong></p>
				<p>Part of the data is collected to ensure the error-free provision of the website. Other data may be
					used to analyze your user behavior.</p>
				<p><strong>What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></p>
				<p>You have the right at any time to receive free information about the origin, recipient, and purpose
					of your stored personal data. You also have the right to request the correction or deletion of this
					data. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the legal notice if you have any
					further questions about data protection. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with
					the competent supervisory authority.</p>
				<p>You also have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under
					certain circumstances. You will find details on this in the privacy policy under "Right to
					restriction of processing".</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 3 External Hosting</strong></p>
				<p>This website is hosted by an external service provider (hoster). The personal data collected on this
					website is stored on the hoster's servers. This may include, but is not limited to, IP addresses,
					contact requests, meta and communication data, contract data, contact details, names, website
					accesses, and other data generated by a website.</p>
				<p>The use of the hoster is for the purpose of fulfilling the contract with our potential and existing
					customers (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR) and in the interest of a secure, fast, and efficient
					provision of our online offer by a professional provider (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR).</p>
				<p>Our hoster will only process your data to the extent necessary to fulfill its service obligations and
					will follow our instructions regarding this data.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 4 Note on the Responsible Party</strong></p>
				<p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
				<p><strong>Auto Weldert GmbH</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Patrickstr. 36</strong></p>
				<p><strong>65191 Wiesbaden</strong></p>
				<p><strong>T</strong> +49 611 567575</p>
				<p><strong>F</strong> +49 611 653802</p>
				<p><strong>E</strong> info@auto-weldert.de</p>
				<p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the
					purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 5 Withdrawal of Your Consent to Data Processing</strong></p>
				<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your
					consent at any time. An informal notification by e-mail to us is sufficient for this purpose. The
					legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the
					revocation.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 6 Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Marketing (Art. 21
						GDPR)</strong></p>
				<p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
					TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR
					PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL
					BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU OBJECT,
					WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING
					LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE
					PROCESSING SERVES THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART.
					21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
				<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY
					TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING;
					THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT,
					YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING
					(OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 7 Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</strong></p>
				<p>In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a
					supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of
					work, or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without
					prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 8 Right to Data Portability</strong></p>
				<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in
					fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable
					format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only
					be done if it is technically feasible.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 9 SSL or TLS Encryption</strong></p>
				<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of
					confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can
					recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from
					"http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
				<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 10 Information, Deletion, and Correction</strong></p>
				<p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
					information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data
					processing, and if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at
					any time at the address given in the legal notice if you have any further questions on the subject
					of personal data.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 11 Right to Restriction of Processing</strong></p>
				<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can
					contact us at any time at the address given in the legal notice. The right to restrict processing
					exists in the following cases:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify
						this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the
						processing of your personal data.</li>
					<li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data
						processing instead of deletion.</li>
					<li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion
						of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
						personal data instead of deletion.</li>
					<li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck
						between your interests and our interests. As long as it has not yet been determined whose
						interests outweigh the other, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
						your personal data.</li>
					<li>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage
						– may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal
						claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of
						an important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 12 Objection to Advertising E-mails</strong></p>
				<p>The use of contact data published within the scope of the legal notice obligation for the
					transmission of unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby objected to. The
					operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the
					unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam e-mails.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 13 Data Collection on this Website</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
				<p>The internet pages partly use so-called cookies. Cookies do not damage your computer and do not
					contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Cookies
					are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser. Most of the cookies
					we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after the end of your visit.
					Other cookies remain stored on your terminal device until you delete them. These cookies enable us
					to recognize your browser on your next visit. You can set your browser so that you are informed
					about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of
					cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing
					the browser. The functionality of this website may be limited when cookies are deactivated. Cookies
					that are required to carry out the electronic communication process or to provide certain functions
					you request (e.g., shopping cart function) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
					The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies for the technically
					error-free and optimized provision of its services. Insofar as a corresponding consent has been
					requested (e.g., consent to the storage of cookies), the processing is carried out exclusively on
					the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the consent can be revoked at any time. Insofar as other
					cookies (e.g., cookies to analyze your surfing behavior) are stored, these are treated separately in
					this privacy policy.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 14 Cookie Consent with Borlabs Cookie</strong></p>
				<p>Our website uses the cookie consent technology of Borlabs Cookie to obtain your consent to the
					storage of certain cookies in your browser and to document this in compliance with data protection
					regulations. The provider of this technology is Borlabs – Benjamin A. Bornschein, Georg-Wilhelm-Str.
					17, 21107 Hamburg, Germany (hereinafter referred to as Borlabs). When you enter our website, a
					Borlabs cookie is stored in your browser, which stores the consents you have given or the revocation
					of these consents. This data is not passed on to the provider of Borlabs Cookie.</p>
				<p>The collected data is stored until you ask us to delete it, delete the Borlabs cookie yourself, or
					the purpose for data storage no longer applies. Mandatory legal retention periods remain unaffected.
					Details on the data processing of Borlabs Cookie can be found at
					https://de.borlabs.io/kb/welche-daten-speichert-borlabs-cookie/ The Borlabs cookie consent
					technology is used to obtain the legally required consents for the use of cookies. The legal basis
					for this is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 15 Server Log Files</strong></p>
				<p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log
					files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Browser type and browser version</li>
					<li>Operating system used</li>
					<li>Referrer URL</li>
					<li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
					<li>Time of the server request</li>
					<li>IP address</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
				<p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a
					legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of its website – for
					this purpose, the server log files must be recorded.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 16 Contact Form</strong></p>
				<p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the
					contact data you provided there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and
					in the event of follow-up questions. We will not pass on this data without your consent. The
					processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, provided your inquiry is related to
					the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In
					all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of
					inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a
					GDPR) if this has been requested. The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until
					you request its deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer
					applies (e.g., after your inquiry has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular
					retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 17 Inquiry by E-mail, Telephone, or Fax</strong></p>
				<p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone, or fax, your inquiry, including all personal data resulting
					from it (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your
					request. We will not pass on this data without your consent. The processing of this data is based on
					Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, provided your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is
					necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is
					based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para.
					1 lit. f GDPR), as we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed
					to us. The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request its
					deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g.,
					after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular legal retention
					periods – remain unaffected.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 18 Plugins and Tools</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Google Web Fonts</strong></p>
				<p>This site uses so-called web fonts, provided by Google, for the uniform display of fonts. The Google
					Fonts are installed locally. A connection to Google's servers does not take place.</p>
				<p><strong>Google Maps (with consent)</strong></p>
				<p>This website uses the Google Maps map service via an API. The provider is Google Ireland Limited
					(“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. To ensure data protection on this
					website, Google Maps is deactivated when you first enter this website. A direct connection to
					Google's servers is only established when you independently activate Google Maps (consent according
					to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). This prevents your data from being transferred to Google when you
					first enter the page. After activation, Google Maps will store your IP address. This is then usually
					transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this site has no
					influence on this data transmission after Google Maps has been activated.</p>
				<p>For more information on the handling of user data, please refer to Google's privacy policy: <a
						href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/</a>.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 19 Own Services</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Handling of Applicant Data</strong></p>
				<p>We offer you the opportunity to apply for jobs with us (e.g., by e-mail, postal mail, or via online
					application form). In the following, we inform you about the scope, purpose, and use of your
					personal data collected as part of the application process. We assure you that the collection,
					processing, and use of your data will be carried out in accordance with applicable data protection
					law and all other statutory provisions, and that your data will be treated with strict
					confidentiality.</p>
				<p><strong>Scope and Purpose of Data Collection</strong></p>
				<p>If you send us an application, we process your associated personal data (e.g., contact and
					communication data, application documents, notes from job interviews, etc.) to the extent necessary
					to decide on the establishment of an employment relationship. The legal basis for this is § 2
