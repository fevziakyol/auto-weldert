				<p><strong>GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS of Auto Weldert GmbH</strong></p>
				<p><strong>for the execution of work on motor vehicles, trailers, units and their parts, and for the
						preparation of cost
						estimates (Motor Vehicle Repair Conditions - recommended by the German Association of the
						Automotive Trade,
						Bonn).</strong></p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 1 Order Placement</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>The services to be rendered shall be specified in the order form or in a confirmation letter,
						and the expected
						or binding completion date shall be indicated.</li>
					<li>The customer shall receive a copy of the order form.</li>
					<li>The order authorizes the contractor to subcontract and to carry out test drives and transfer
						trips.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 2 Price Indications in the Order Form; Cost Estimate</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>At the customer's request, the contractor shall also note in the order form the prices that are
						likely to be
						charged for the execution of the order. Price indications in the order form can also be made by
						reference to the
						relevant items in the price and labor value catalogs available at the contractor's premises.
					</li>
					<li>If the customer desires a binding price indication, a written cost estimate is required; this
						shall list the
						work and spare parts individually, each with its respective price. The contractor shall be bound
						by this cost
						estimate until the expiry of 3 weeks after its submission. The services rendered for the
						submission of a cost
						estimate may be charged to the customer if this has been agreed in individual cases. If an order
						is placed based
						on the cost estimate, any costs for the cost estimate shall be offset against the order invoice,
						and the total
						price may only be exceeded when calculating the order with the customer's consent.</li>
					<li>If the order form contains price indications, the value-added tax must be stated, as with a cost
						estimate.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 3 Completion</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>The contractor is obliged to adhere to a completion date designated in writing as binding. If
						the scope of work
						changes or expands compared to the original order and this results in a delay, the contractor
						must immediately
						state a new completion date, indicating the reasons.</li>
					<li>If the contractor culpably fails to meet a completion date expressly agreed in writing for
						orders concerning the
						repair of a motor vehicle by more than 24 hours, the contractor shall, at its option, provide
						the customer free
						of charge with a replacement vehicle of the most comparable standard according to the
						contractor's currently
						valid conditions, or reimburse 80% of the costs for the actual use of a rental vehicle of the
						most comparable
						standard. The customer shall return the replacement or rental vehicle immediately upon
						notification of the
						completion of the ordered item; further claims for damages due to delay are excluded, except in
						cases of intent
						or gross negligence. The contractor is also responsible for the accidental impossibility of
						performance
						occurring during the delay, unless the damage would have occurred even if the service had been
						rendered on time.
					</li>
					<li>For commercially used vehicles, the contractor may, instead of providing a replacement vehicle
						or covering
						rental car costs, compensate for the loss of earnings caused by the delayed completion.</li>
					<li>If the contractor cannot meet the completion date due to force majeure or operational
						disruptions for which it
						is not responsible, there shall be no obligation to pay damages due to the resulting delays, in
						particular not
						to provide a replacement vehicle or to reimburse the costs for the actual use of a rental
						vehicle. However, the
						contractor is obliged to inform the customer of the delays, insofar as this is possible and
						reasonable.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 4 Acceptance</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Acceptance of the ordered item by the customer shall take place at the contractor's premises,
						unless otherwise
						agreed.</li>
					<li>The customer is obliged to collect the repaired item within 1 week of receipt of the
						notification of completion
						and handover or dispatch of the invoice. In the event of non-acceptance, the contractor may
						exercise its
						statutory rights. For repair work that is carried out within one working day, the deadline is
						shortened to 2
						working days.</li>
					<li>In the event of a delay in acceptance, the contractor may charge the customary local storage
						fee. The ordered
						item may also be stored elsewhere at the contractor's discretion. The costs and risks of storage
						shall be borne
						by the customer.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 5 Calculation of the Order</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>The invoice shall separately show prices or price factors for each technically self-contained
						work performance,
						as well as for used spare parts and materials. If the customer requests collection or delivery
						of the ordered
						item, this shall be at their expense and risk. Liability for negligence remains unaffected.</li>
					<li>If the order is executed based on a binding cost estimate, a reference to the cost estimate
						shall suffice, with
						only additional work to be listed separately.</li>
					<li>The calculation of the exchange price in the exchange process presupposes that the removed unit
						or part
						corresponds to the scope of delivery of the replacement unit or part and that it has no damage
						that makes
						reconditioning impossible.</li>
					<li>The value-added tax shall be borne by the customer.</li>
					<li>Any correction of the invoice by the contractor, as well as any complaint by the customer, must
						be made no later
						than 6 weeks after receipt of the invoice.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 6 Payment</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>The invoice amount and prices for ancillary services are due for payment in cash or by EC card
						upon acceptance
						of the repaired item and handover or dispatch of the invoice, but no later than 1 week after
						notification of
						completion and handover or dispatch of the invoice.</li>
					<li>The customer may only offset claims of the contractor if the customer's counterclaim is
						undisputed or there is a
						legally binding title; they may only assert a right of retention insofar as it is based on
						claims arising from
						the repair order. The contractor is entitled to demand a reasonable advance payment upon placing
						the order.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 7 Extended Lien</strong></p>
				<p>The contractor shall have a contractual lien on the items that have come into its possession as a
					result of the order
					to secure its claims arising from the order. The contractual lien may also be asserted for claims
					arising from
					previously performed work, spare parts deliveries, and other services, insofar as they are related
					to the ordered
					item. For other claims arising from the business relationship, the contractual lien shall only apply
					if these are
					undisputed or there is a legally binding title and the ordered item belongs to the customer.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 8 Material Defect</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>The customer's claims for material defects shall become statute-barred one year after acceptance
						of the repaired
						item. If the customer accepts the ordered item despite knowledge of a defect, they shall only be
						entitled to
						claims for material defects to the extent described in paragraphs 4 to 5 if they reserve these
						rights upon
						acceptance.</li>
					<li>If the object of the order is the delivery of movable goods to be manufactured or produced, and
						the customer is
						a legal entity under public law, a special fund under public law, or an entrepreneur who, when
						concluding the
						contract, is acting in the exercise of their commercial or independent professional activity,
						the customer's
						claims for material defects shall become statute-barred one year after delivery. For other
						customers
						(consumers), the statutory provisions shall apply in this case.</li>
					<li>In the event of fraudulent concealment of defects or the assumption of a guarantee for the
						quality, further
						claims shall remain unaffected.</li>
					<li>The following applies to the handling of defect rectification:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Claims for defect rectification must be asserted by the customer to the contractor; in
								the case of
								verbal notifications, the contractor shall provide the customer with a written
								confirmation of receipt
								of the notification.</li>
							<li>If the repaired item becomes inoperable due to a material defect, the customer may, with
								the prior
								consent of the contractor, contact another master automotive workshop.</li>
							<li>Replaced parts shall become the property of the contractor.</li>
							<li>For the parts installed for defect rectification, the buyer may assert claims for
								material defects based
								on the order until the expiry of the limitation period of the customer's item.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>If, in the exceptional case of paragraph 4b), the defect rectification is carried out in another
						specialist
						workshop (belonging to the contractor's sales organization), the customer must have it recorded
						in the order
						form that this concerns the execution of a defect rectification by the contractor and that these
						removed parts
						must be kept available for a reasonable period. The contractor is obliged to reimburse the
						repair costs
						demonstrably incurred by the customer.</li>
					<li>§ 8 Material Defect shall not apply to claims for damages; § 9 Liability shall apply to these
						claims.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 9 Liability</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>If the contractor is liable for damage caused by slight negligence according to the statutory
						provisions, the
						contractor's liability shall be limited, insofar as there has been no injury to life, limb, or
						health. Liability
						shall only exist for the breach of essential contractual obligations and shall be limited to the
						typical damage
						foreseeable at the time of conclusion of the contract. Insofar as the damage is covered by
						insurance taken out
						by the customer for the relevant damage event (excluding sum insurance), the contractor shall
						only be liable for
						any associated disadvantages of the customer, e.g., higher insurance premiums or interest
						disadvantages up to
						the settlement of the claim by the insurance. The same applies to damage caused by a defect in
						the ordered item.
						Liability for the loss of money, securities (including savings books, checkbooks, check and
						credit cards),
						valuables, and items of value of any kind that are not expressly taken into safekeeping is
						excluded.
						If the customer is a legal entity under public law, a special fund under public law, or an
						entrepreneur who,
						when placing the order, is acting in the exercise of their commercial or independent
						professional activity, and
						claims for damages are asserted after the expiry of one year after acceptance or, in the case of
						delivery of
						movable goods to be manufactured or produced, after delivery of the ordered item, the following
						shall apply:
						The above limitation of liability shall also apply to damage caused by gross negligence, but not
						in the case of
						gross negligence caused by legal representatives or senior employees of the contractor, and
						furthermore not for
						damage caused by gross negligence that is covered by insurance taken out by the customer for the
						relevant damage
						event.</li>
					<li>Regardless of any fault on the part of the contractor, any liability of the contractor for
						fraudulent
						concealment of a defect, from the assumption of a guarantee or a procurement risk, and under the
						Product
						Liability Act shall remain unaffected.</li>
					<li>The personal liability of the legal representatives, vicarious agents, and employees of the
						contractor for
						damage caused by slight negligence on their part is excluded.</li>
					<li>Liability shall only exist for the breach of essential contractual obligations, such as those
						that the purchase
						contract specifically intends to impose on the seller according to its content and purpose, or
						whose fulfillment
						is essential for the proper execution of the purchase contract in the first place and on whose
						compliance the
						buyer regularly relies and may rely. This liability is limited to the typical damage foreseeable
						at the time of
						conclusion of the contract.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 10 Retention of Title</strong></p>
				<p>Insofar as installed accessories, spare parts, and units have not become essential components of the
					ordered item,
					the contractor reserves ownership thereof until full and undisputed payment has been made.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 11 Arbitration Board (Expert Arbitration Procedure)</strong></p>
				<p>(Applies only to vehicles with a permissible total weight of no more than 3.5 tons)</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In the event of disputes arising from this order, the customer or, with their consent, the
						contractor may appeal
						to the arbitration board of the motor vehicle trade or industry responsible for the contractor.
						The appeal must
						be made in writing without delay after becoming aware of the point of dispute.</li>
					<li>The decision of the arbitration board does not exclude recourse to the courts.</li>
					<li>The appeal to the arbitration board suspends the statute of limitations for the duration of the
						proceedings.
					</li>
					<li>The procedure before the arbitration board is governed by its rules of procedure, which will be
						provided to the
						parties by the arbitration board upon request.</li>
					<li>An appeal to the arbitration board is excluded if legal action has already been taken. If legal
						action is taken
						during arbitration proceedings, the arbitration board shall cease its activities.</li>
					<li>The arbitration board procedure is free of charge for the customer.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 12 Place of Jurisdiction</strong></p>
				<p>For all current and future claims arising from the business relationship with merchants, including
					claims arising
					from bills of exchange and checks, the exclusive place of jurisdiction shall be the registered
					office of the
					contractor. The same place of jurisdiction shall apply if the customer does not have a general place
					of jurisdiction
					in Germany, moves their domicile or habitual residence out of Germany after conclusion of the
					contract, or if their
					domicile or habitual residence is unknown at the time the action is brought.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>§ 13 Final Provision</strong></p>
				<p>Should one of the above clauses be ineffective, this shall not affect the effectiveness of the
					remaining clauses
					contained in the above conditions. An arrangement that comes as close as possible to the meaning and
					economic
					purpose of the ineffective clause shall replace the ineffective clause.</p>
